# Sample-REST-API
A sample node.js Express application to demonstrate REST API capabilities
 
<h2>Developing REST API:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I loaded some JSON data (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_scientific_discoveries) into MongoDB and used Mongoose to connect, model, and query the data (see models/discovery.js)</li>
<li>The REST API functionalities can be found in routes/api.js</li>
<li>The front end is React.js based that allows users to input a year and look for scientific discoveries around that period</li>
</ul>

Please note that this is an experimental application.
